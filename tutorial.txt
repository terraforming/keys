TO FIX THIS ERROR:

If the server you are connecting to uses a self-signed certificate, you must
configure chef to trust that server's certificate.

By default, the certificate is stored in the following location on the host
where your chef-server runs:

  /var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/SERVER_HOSTNAME.crt

Copy that file to your trusted_certs_dir (currently: /home/ubuntu/.chef/trusted_certs)
using SSH/SCP or some other secure method, then re-run this command to confirm
that the server's certificate is now trusted.
